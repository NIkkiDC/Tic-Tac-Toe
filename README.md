# Tic-Tac-Toe

I will first complete the simple things first, then add in some Javascript. I will alternate back and forth for the first 45 min, so I dont stress myself out with the JS, since that is where I have issues

In the next hour I will then soley focus on the JS to make sure the game is started, I will then do google searches as well as look at my notes to check to see if their is anything that can help me create a game like tic-tak-toe.(It really isnt)
