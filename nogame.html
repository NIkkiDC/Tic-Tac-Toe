    <h4> Are you always this difficult!? I will give you a second chance to play the game since 
        it is a REALLY fun game, but you still have to agree to the rules. If I were you I 
        would agree to the rules, so I could play the game! Choice is yours! Your already here 
        so play! Im not asking you anymore, at this point I am telling you!
