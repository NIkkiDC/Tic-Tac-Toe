    <h4> Are you always this difficult!? I will give you a second chance to play the game since 
        it is a REALLY fun game, but you still have to agree to the rules. If I were you I 
        would agree to the rules, so I could play the game! Choice is yours! Your already here 
        so play! Im not asking you anymore, at this point I am telling you!

    <h1> HISTORY OF Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    <h4> WHERE DID THE NAME COME FROM?
      The early Roman version was known as terni lapilli, or three pebbles at a time. In the mid-1800s, 
      Britain used the name noughts and crosses, with nought referring to the O‚Äôs (or zeros) used in the game.
      The phrase tick-tack-toe wasn‚Äôt used until the late 1800s, and there‚Äôs some findings that report it might 
      have been used to describe a completely different game. 
      The United States officially adopted the name tic tac toe in the 20th century. Historians aren‚Äôt completely 
      clear about the origin of the game‚Äôs name, but it could be referring to the noise of repetitive ticking or 
      writing that goes along with the game‚Äôs play.</h4>
